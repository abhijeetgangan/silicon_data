# GNN model weights
1) si_gnn_rdf_pretrained - Trained with previous weights with RDF in the loss function
2) si_gnn_rdf_pretrained_low_lr - Trained with previous weights with RDF in the loss function with a lower learning rate
3) si_gnn_rdf_scratch - Trained from scratch with RDF in the loss function
4) si_gnn_scratch - Trained from scratch
