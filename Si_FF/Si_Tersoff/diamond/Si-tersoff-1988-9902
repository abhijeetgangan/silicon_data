# Tersoff parameters for various elements and mixtures
# multiple entries can be added to this file, LAMMPS reads the ones it needs
# these entries are in LAMMPS "metal" units:
#   A,B = eV; lambda1,lambda2,lambda3 = 1/Angstroms; R,D = Angstroms
#   other quantities are unitless

# Aidan Thompson (athomps at sandia.gov) takes full blame for this
# file.  It specifies various potentials published by J. Tersoff for
# silicon, carbon and germanium. Since Tersoff published several
# different silicon potentials, I refer to them using atom types
# Si(B), Si(C) and Si(D). The last two are almost almost identical but
# refer to two different publications. These names should be used in
# the LAMMPS command when the file is invoked. For example:
# pair_coeff * * SiCGe.tersoff Si(B).  The Si(D), C and Ge potentials
# can be used pure silicon, pure carbon, pure germanium, binary SiC,
# and binary SiGe, but not binary GeC or ternary SiGeC. LAMMPS will
# generate an error if this file is used with any combination
# involving C and Ge, since there are no entries for the GeC
# interactions (Tersoff did not publish parameters for this
# cross-interaction.)

# format of a single entry (one or more lines):
#   element 1, element 2, element 3, 
#   m, gamma, lambda3, c, d, costheta0, n, beta, lambda2, B, R, D, lambda1, A

# The later Tersoff potential for Silicon, Si(C)
# J. Tersoff, PRB, 38, 9902 (1988)
